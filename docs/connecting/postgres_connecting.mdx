## Creating your connection URI

1. Gather the following details for a user on your Postgres database:

    1. username (often `postgres`)
    2. password
    3. host
    4. port
    5. database
    6. schema
    7. table name

<Tip>If you are starting with a full connection URI string, it should follow the format below:</Tip>

```shell Postgres Connection URI
postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][,...][/database][?param1=value1&...]
```

2. Enter the details above to the web app at app.usebracket.com

## Assigning user permissions

For Bracket to be able to be able to generate Postgres tables from other primary sources, we require the following permissions, which can be assigned via SQL.

```shell Database-level permissions
GRANT CONNECT, CREATE ON DATABASE [your_database] TO [bracket_username];
```
```shell Schema-level permissions
GRANT USAGE, CREATE, ALTER, REFERENCES ON SCHEMA [your_schema] TO [bracket_username];
```
For Bracket to be able to sync with an existing Postgres table, we require the following permissions:

```shell Schema-level permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, REFERENCES, TRIGGER ON [your_table] TO [bracket_username];
```

## Optional: Creating a read only user on your database
<Note>Perform this step if you would like to give Bracket access through a dedicated account. Skip this step if you prefer to use an existing Postgres account during setup.</Note>

1. Create a new user and password

```shell Postgres User Creation
CREATE USER bracket WITH PASSWORD 'any_safe_password';
```

2. Allow this new user to connect to the database

```shell Postgres Connection Access
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE database_name TO bracket;
```

3. Allow Usage on the schema (typically 'public')

```shell Postgres Connection Access
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA schema_name TO bracket;
```

4. Allow read access on a specific table

```shell Postgres Connection Access
GRANT SELECT ON table_name TO bracket;
```
