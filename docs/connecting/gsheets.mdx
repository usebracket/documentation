## Setting up your Google Sheet

To sync Google Sheets using Bracket, there are two basic requirements:
    1. The row headers must start at row 1
    2. The sheet must have a primary field column that contains unique values. This can be as simple as an integer, or more complex like a UUIDV4
    <Tip>Here's a helpful Sheets formula to generate more complex unique IDs: `=DEC2HEX(RANDBETWEEN(0, 4294967295), 8)`</Tip>


## Connecting with a Service Account

Share your spreadsheet with the Bracket service account `bracket@central-run-344416.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

<Example>
    <img class="rounded-md w-6/12" src="/img/gsheets-1.png" />
</Example>

## Setting up the sync on the web app

1. Enter the spreadsheet ID from the URL (hint: it's the string after "/d/" and before the next "/" in the URL, see below)

```shell Spresheet Link Example
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/edit#gid=0
```

2.Collect and share the sheet name, e.g. Sheet1

<Example>
    <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/gsheets-2.png" />
</Example>

3. Enter the name of the sheet's primary key field.
