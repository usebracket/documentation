## Summary

Bracket lets you connect CRMs and databases for two-way or one-way syncs. In this guide, we'll talk through how to get everything connected in a few quick steps.

<Info>If you'd like to join a private Slack or Discord group with our team for support or questions, just ping us at eng@usebracket.com</Info>

## 1. Prepare your data sources for the sync

The prerequisites for a successful sync are:
1. Both data sources are set up (i.e., Bracket does not host on your behalf)
2. The secondary data source is empty of data.

<Tip>Note that if Postgres is your secondary source, you do not need to have a table created before setting up your sync - Bracket can generate it for you.</Tip>

## 2. Create an account on our web app

## 3. Enter connection details for each data source

On the web app, you'll need to enter certain connection details to get syncs running. See below for a summary of what information you'll need.

| Data source                                  | What you'll need                                                                                                                  |

## 4. Review the fields to be synced and choose sync direction

On this page, you can remove any fields that you do not want synced. While Bracket auto-maps fields based on field names, you can also adjust the mapping as needed.

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/onboarding_field_mapping.gif" />
</Example>

## 5. Name your sync and choose sync frequency.

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/onboarding_name_sync.gif" />
</Example>

## 6. Initiate sync

When you create your sync, your primary source will automatically seed the secondary source if the secondary source is empty of data.

<Warning>If the secondary data source is already populated, the seed will fail. However, we strongly recommend clearing the secondary source before trying to run another sync job, otherwise you may duplicate data.</Warning>


After that initial seed, to make sure the sync will work as expected, click "Test run," then refresh the page to see te result of the test.

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/starting_test_run.gif" />
</Example>

Then, click "Run once" or toggle the sync to `Active` to begin the sync. Refresh the page to verify that a sync job has been planned.

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/starting_sfdc_sync.gif" />
</Example>
