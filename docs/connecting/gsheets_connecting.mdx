## Setting up your Google Sheet

To sync Google Sheets using Bracket, there are three basic requirements:
    1. The field names must start at row 1. There can be no extra rows above the table.
    2. The field names must be unique across the table, even among fields that are not syncing.
    3. The sheet must have a primary field column that contains unique values. This can be as simple as an integer, or more complex like a UUIDV4.
    <Warning>These conditions must always be met in the Sheet for the sync to work!</Warning>
    <Tip>Here's a helpful Sheets formula to generate more complex unique IDs: `=DEC2HEX(RANDBETWEEN(0, 4294967295), 8)`</Tip>


## Connecting with the Bracket Service Account

Share your spreadsheet with the Bracket Service Account by sharing access to this email address: eng@usebracket.com.

<Note>Note that Bracket will generate a unique Google Service Account for every sheet you connect. Generating an account can take a few minutes and is necessary to begin your sync.</Note>


## Setting up the sync on the web app

1. Enter the spreadsheet ID from the URL (hint: it's the string after "/d/" and before the next "/" in the URL, as shown by the "XXXX" string below)

```shell Spresheet Link Example
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/edit#gid=0
```

2. Collect and share the sheet name, e.g. Sheet1

<Example>
    <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/gsheets-2.png" />
</Example>

3. Enter the name of the sheet's primary key field.
