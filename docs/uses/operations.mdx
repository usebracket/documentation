Bidirectional data syncing has many applications for Ops teams that need to add on-the-ground context to the company's data warehouse.

## Understanding missed SLAs

Your logistics company has bespoke SLA arrangements with several key customers. However, your warehouse management system is inflexible with SLA rule-setting, so your SLA performance data for these bespoke clients is not useful. You need your Warehouse Ops teams to be able to edit SLA outcomes for these bespoke orders, and you need your backend data to reflect those changes. Otherwise, your SLA performance analytics are not useful.

With Bracket, you can set up a Google Sheet for each warehouse that gets automatically populated with daily orders from these bespoke clients. The team on the ground can indicate SLA timeliness for these orders, which finally makes your SLA performance analytics complete.

## Dealing with damaged inventory

Inventory management systems are clunky, and many e-commerce and logistics companies want to use simpler tools (like Notion) for inventory management. The problem: Ops teams are the first to know when inventory is damaged, but they can't easily write to the backend database. When backend inventory data is inaccurate, it can cause unexpected out of stock situations.

With Bracket, Ops teams can indicate damaged inventory in real-time, making sure inventory data in the backend is indeed a source of truth.
