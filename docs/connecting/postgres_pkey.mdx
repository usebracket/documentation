## Summary

To maintain database integrity over time, we recommend that your Postgres table have an **independent** primary key - that is, your Postgres table should not take the primary key values from the opposing data source in the sync. 

## How to set up your primary key

Each Postgres table you sync with Bracket should have a primary key constraint, and the primary key should have a default value that is unique. We recommend using UUIDV4 primary keys, which you can automatically generate using the command below in your `create table` SQL statement.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.table
    (pkey text COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4())
```
This ensures that all newly added records, whether inserted directly to Postgres or synced from a paired data source, will adopt primary keys with uniform formatting and unique values. 

In the field mapping, you are able to sync the primary key to a field in the opposing data source for reference, but any edits made to the primary key in the opposing source will not sync back to Postgres.
