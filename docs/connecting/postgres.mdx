## Creating your connection URI

1. Gather the following details for your Postgres entity:

- username (see instructions below), password, host, port, database, schema and/or table name

2. Create the connection URI with the following format.

```shell Postgres Connection URI
postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][,...][/database][?param1=value1&...]
```

3. Upload the connection URI and table name to https://www.usebracket.com/onboarding

## Creating a read only user on your database

1. Create a new user and password

```shell Postgres User Creation
CREATE USER bracket WITH PASSWORD 'any_safe_password';
```

2. Allow this new user to connect to the database

```shell Postgres Connection Access
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE database_name TO bracket;
```

3. Allow Usage on the schema (typically 'public')

```shell Postgres Connection Access
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA schema_name TO bracket;
```

4. Allow read access on a specific table

```shell Postgres Connection Access
GRANT SELECT ON table_name TO bracket;
```
