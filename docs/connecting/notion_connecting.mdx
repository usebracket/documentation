## Connecting via oauth

1. On the [new connections page](https://app.usebracket.com/), select `notion`

2. Click "Link new bases"

3. Click "Select pages", then check the page in which your database lives. Click "Allow access"

<Info>Note that if your database is a subpage within a Notion page, you may not see it listed here. Choose the parent page for the database, and you'll be ablet to select the exact database at the next step.</Info>

<Info>Bracket also supports syncs using Notion integration tokens, but support for these is deprecated on the web-app. Ping us if you prefer to connect using this method.</Info>
