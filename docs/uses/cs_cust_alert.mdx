title: 'Customer Alerts'
---

The companies with support teams that are praised by customers are ones that proactively support customers during key interactions with the product. For example, if a customer encounters an error when interacting with your product and the error message is not clear, a customer support specialist should intervene before the user leaves the web app.

Luckily, with Bracket, when an error occurs it can be sent to Airtable to notify customer support on which customer and what error occurred. If the error message isn’t clear, customer support can change it in Airtable which will automatically sync to Postgres and show up on the front end of the web app directly. Engineers aren’t needed beyond the initial Airtable <> Postgres set up and customer support teams are blocked by engineers who have a backlog of requests.
