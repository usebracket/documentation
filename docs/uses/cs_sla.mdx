When running customer support, meeting SLAs helps provide an ideal customer experience and reduces chances of churn for a competitor whose customer service may be better. Building a dashboard that offers visibility into team performance helps keep track of key support metrics like ticket volume, response time, and time to resolution.

With Bracket, you can pull all this data from MongoDB straight into Airtable to view overall support metrics across the team and for individuals.
