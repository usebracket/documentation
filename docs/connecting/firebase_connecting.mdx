## Getting your Firestore project ID

There are three different ways to get your Firestore project ID:

1. **Using the Firebase console**: Click settings Project settings. The project ID is displayed in the top pane.
2. Using the Firebase CLI: Run `firebase projects:list`. The project ID is displayed along with all the Firebase projects associated with your account.
3. Using the Firebase Management REST API: Call `projects.list`. The response body contains the project ID in the `FirebaseProject` object.

## Generating private keys for a service account

1. Navigate to your project's console

2. Go to Project Settings by clicking the icon

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md h-32" src="/img/firebase-1.png" />
</Example>

3. Click `Service accounts`

4. Generate a new private key by clicking on `Generate new private key` and open the newly-created JSON

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/firebase-2.png" />
</Example>

<Tip>The private key should begin with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and end with `\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n`</Tip>

## Getting the client email for a service account

The JSON that you created by generating a private key (above) will include a `client_email` field. Paste that in the Bracket web app. 

<Warning>This is not a personal email address</Warning>


## Getting the collection path

In Firestore, data is organized in an alternating hierarchy of `collection/document/collection/document`. You can read about this hierarchy [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#hierarchical-data).

This means that a collection path should always have an odd number of elements. In the example below, `mycoll` and `mycoll/mydoc/mysubcoll` are both valid collection paths.

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/firestore_collection_path_example.png" />
</Example>

## Collection groups

Firestore collection groups allow you to run queries over multiple related collections at once (you can read more [here](https://firebase.blog/posts/2019/06/understanding-collection-group-queries)). If the collection path refers to collection group, then check this box.
