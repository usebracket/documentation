Bracket lets you connect popular tools and backend databases for two-way or one-way syncs. In this guide, we'll talk through how to get everything connected in a few quick steps.

<Info>If you'd like to join a private Slack or Discord group with our team for support or questions, just ping us at founders@usebracket.com</Info>

## 1. Prepare your data sources for the sync

The prerequisites for a successful sync are:
1. Both data sources exist (i.e., Bracket does not host on your behalf)
2. Both data sources have a [unique key](/pkeys)
3. The secondary data source is empty of data

## 2. Create an account on our web app

## 3. Enter connection details for each data source

On the web app, you'll need to enter certain connection details to get syncs running. See below for a summary of what information you'll need.

| Data source                                  | What you'll need                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------      | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Airtable](/connecting/airtable_connecting)      | An existing Airtable base                                                                                                |
| [Notion](/connecting/notion_connecting)          | An existing Notion database                                                                 |
| [Google Sheets](/connecting/gsheets_connecting)  | Share Sheet with Bracket service account and get the Sheet ID                                                                     |
| [Postgres](/connecting/postgres_connecting)      | Connection string URI                                                                                                             |
| [MongoDB](/database/mongodb_connecting)          | Connection string URI with Bracket as added user and whitelisting IP address 0.0.0.0/0 _or_ Bracket's dedicated IP addresses      |
| [Snowflake](/database/snowflake_connecting)      | Login credentials and details about the warehouse / table to be synced                                                            |

## 4. Review the fields to be synced and choose sync direction

On this page, you can remove any fields that you do not want synced. While Bracket auto-maps fields based on field names, you can also adjust the mapping as needed. 

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/onboarding_field_mapping.gif" />
</Example>

## 5. Name your sync and choose sync frequency.

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/onboarding_name_sync.gif" />
</Example>

If you are using the [legacy app](https://legacy.app.usebracket.com/) before initiating the sync, you should make sure the field names and intersection types are accurate:
1. Verify that the field names for each data source have appropriate capitalization, spaces, etc. On the legacy app, field names are case-sensitive.
2. Verify that `INTERSECTION TYPE` is accurate. You can figure out the appropriate intersection type [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J9_1I608ARf06TohXeauN9tA477pUxLOvfTHuIOFa-0/edit?usp=sharing)

## 6. Test and initiate sync

To make sure the sync will work as expected, click "Test run," then refresh the page to see te result of the test.

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/starting_test_run.gif" />
</Example>

Then, click "Run once" or toggle the sync to `Active` to begin the sync. Refresh the page to verify that a sync job has been planned.
