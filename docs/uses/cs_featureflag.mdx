**Problem:** Startups are constantly experimenting with pricing plans and the features they unlock. Beyond that, startups often want to customize their product UX for high-value & enterprise users. Usually, the Sales and CX teams know most about which features a user should be able to access, but it falls to engineering to actually implement the feature flags.

**How Bracket helps:** Get your sales and CX team to have full control over which features each user sees. If your eng team can simplify feature toggles to boolean fields, then you can use Bracket to sync those toggles between your backend and, e.g., a Google Sheet. 

This allows your CX team full control over a user's experience, and saves engineering time for bigger projects. This setup also doubles as a tool for upselling: give your sales team access to the G Sheet, and they can quickly prioritize upselling based on which features a user can't yet access.
