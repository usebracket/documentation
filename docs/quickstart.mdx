Bracket lets you connect popular tools and backend databases for two-way or one-way syncs. In this guide, we'll talk through how to get everything connected in a few quick steps.

<Info>If you'd like to join a private Slack or Discord group with our team for support or questions, just ping us at founders@usebracket.com</Info>

## 1. Prepare your data sources for the sync

The prerequisites for a successful sync are:
1. Both data sources exist and have at least one field
2. Both data sources have a [unique key](/pkeys)
3. The secondary data source is empty of data

## 2. Create an account on our web app

## 3. Enter connection details for each data source

On the web app, you'll need to enter certain connection details to get syncs running. See below for a summary of what information you'll need.

| Data source                                  | What you'll need                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------      | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Airtable](/connecting/airtable_connecting)      | An existing Airtable base                                                                                                |
| [Notion](/connecting/notion_connecting)          | An existing Notion database                                                                 |
| [Google Sheets](/connecting/gsheets_connecting)  | Share Sheet with Bracket service account and get the Sheet ID                                                                     |
| [Postgres](/connecting/postgres_connecting)      | Connection string URI                                                                                                             |
| [MongoDB](/database/mongodb_connecting)          | Connection string URI with Bracket as added user and whitelisting IP address 0.0.0.0/0 _or_ Bracket's dedicated IP addresses      |
| [Snowflake](/database/snowflake_connecting)      | Login credentials and details about the warehouse / table to be synced                                                            |


## 4. Choose your sync direction

Choose a one-way or two-way sync. If you'd like to customize the sync so that certain fields are one-way and others are two-way, just ping us. 

## 5. Review the fields to be synced and choose sync frequency

After clicking "Review," you'll be taken to the admin page for the newly created connection

Before you initiate the sync, you should:
1. Make sure the field names and intersection types are accurate
    - Verify that the field names for each data source have appropriate capitalization, spaces, etc.
    - Verify that `INTERSECTION TYPE` is accurate. You can figure out the appropriate intersection type [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J9_1I608ARf06TohXeauN9tA477pUxLOvfTHuIOFa-0/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Update the sync frequency as needed. See the different sync frequency options by plan [here](https://www.usebracket.com/pricing)

<Warning>Field names must be identical matches for each respective data source</Warning>


## 6. Initiate sync

Toggle `Active` to begin the sync. Refresh the page and scroll to the bottom to verify that a sync job has been planned.

You can also test the sync without writing data (before or during a sync) by clicking "Test run" on the Job History section. 

<Note>If you need help setting up either side of the sync (e.g., you want to sync Airtable with Postgres but don't have Postgres set up yet), just ping us at eng@usebracket.com! We're happy to help with that setup.</Note>
