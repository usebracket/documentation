## Summary

Bracket offers two methods of syncing data with Salesforce: polling and streaming. 



1. On the Bracket web-app, for either the primary or secondary source, select "Salesforce" from the drop-down.

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/salesforce_drop_down.png" />
</Example>

2. Enter your Salesforce credentials, then click "Next"

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/salesforce-2.png" />
</Example>

3. Select the table you would like to sync from the drop-down menu.
