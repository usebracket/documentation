## Basics

Notion is a popular and flexible multi-use tool. Many companies run basically everything -- from their CRM to their Kanban boards -- in Notion.

With Bracket, you can sync any Notion database with

1. Any SQL database
2. Any NoSQL database, and/or
3. Airtable

## Supported and partially supported fields

The following Notion field types are currently supported:

- Text
- Number
- Select
- Multi-select
- Date
- Person
- Checkbox
- URL
- Email
- Phone
- Created time
- Created by
- Last edited time
- Last edited by
- Formula\*

\*: Bracket can sync the data as a number or string, but full functionality with the paired tool is not guaranteed. For example, a functional formula in Notion may not function in Airtable when synced.

## Unsupported fields

The following Notion fields are not yet supported:

- Files & media
- Relation
- Rollup

## Supported sync configurations

We know everybody has a different use case for Bracket, and we want to help you achieve it! To that end, we support a number of possible syncing configurations.

| Property                                                  | Support                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Number of Notion databases and number of linked databases | We can link any number of Notion databases to any number of database tables/collections. Many:1, 1:many, many:many, and 1:1 are all supported.                                                                                     |
| Number of fields within an Notion database synced         | We can sync any full set or subset of fields within a Notion database to corresponding fields in the linked database(s).                                                                                                           |
| Bidirectional vs. unidirectional syncs                    | Of the synced fields, we can define each as unidirectional or bidirectional. That is, a Notion field can solely read, solely write, or read and write. This helps teams establish implicit permissions over database write access. |
| Filtering data to stay within Notion row limits           | You can set logic such that Notion able is only reading and writing data within specific parameters, e.g. the last 7 days' worth of data from the linked database. This helps teams leverage Notion without hitting row limits.    |

## Schema changes

There are several possible schema changes you can make in Notion. Below, we cover whether these changes break syncing for the entire table and how to handle these changes with a Bracket-connected Notion.

| Type of change                                                                        | Will this break syncing? | What to do                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If a team member unknowingly makes a change that breaks syncing, we will notify you via Slack to confirm the new schema, then update the connection. |

## Row changes

When you change rows in a linked Notion database, certain changes happen in the paired database. Below we list out the default outcome of changes to rows in a synced Notion database. To customize any of these default outcomes, just tell us on Slack.

| Type of change | Default outcome                                                                                                             | Customizable? |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Adding row     | 1. Creates new row in spreadsheet<br />2. Creates new row in SQL database<br />3. Creates new document in NoSQL database    | Yes           |
| Editing row    | If edits are made in a synced field, then edit is pushed to the paired database. Otherwise, the edit only exists in Notion. | Yes           |
| Deleting row   | This does **not** delete the equivalent row or document in the paired database.                                             | Yes           |
