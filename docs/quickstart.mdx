Bracket lets you connect popular tools and backend databases for two-way or one-way syncs. In this guide, we'll talk through how to get everything connected in a few quick steps.

<Info>If you'd like to join a private Slack or Discord group with our team for support or questions, just ping us at founders@usebracket.com</Info>

## 1. Prepare your data sources for the sync

The prerequisites for a successful sync are:
1. Both data sources exist and have at least one field
2. Both data sources have a unique key
3. One data source is empty of data

## 2. Create an account on our web app

## 3. Enter connection details for each data source

On the web app, you'll need to enter certain connection details to get syncs running. See below for a summary of what information you'll need.

| Tool                                  | What you'll need                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------      | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Airtable](/connecting/airtable)      | API key and link to Airtable base                                                                                                 |
| [Notion](/connecting/notion)          | Create integration token and add it to the table you want to sync                                                                 |
| [Google Sheets](/connecting/gsheets)  | Share Sheet with Bracket service account and get the Sheet ID                                                                     |
| [Postgres](/connecting/postgres)      | Connection string URI                                                                                                             |
| [MongoDB](/database/mongodb)          | Connection string URI with Bracket as added user and whitelisting IP address 0.0.0.0/0 _or_ Bracket's dedicated IP addresses      |
| [Snowflake](/database/snowflake)      | Login credentials and details about the warehouse / table to be synced                                                            |


## 4. Choose your sync direction

Choose a one-way or two-way sync. If you'd like to customize the sync so that certain fields are one-way and others are two-way, just ping us. 

## 5. Review the fields to be synced and choose sync frequency

After clicking "Review," you'll be taken to the admin page for the newly created connection

Before you initiate the sync, you should:
1. Make sure the field names and intersection types are accurate
    - `UNIQUE KEY` is just an identifier for that field pairing. It doesn't matter what format this is in.
    - Verify that the field names for each data source have appropriate capitalization, spaces, etc.
    - `INTERSECTION TYPE` is the most granular field type available between the two data source fields. For example, if you are syncing a `select` field in Airtable with a `string` field in Postgres, then choose `select` here.
2. Update the sync frequency as needed. The default frequency is five minutes, and the fastest frequency is one minute.

## 6. Initiate sync

Toggle `Active` to begin the sync. Refresh the page and scroll to the bottom to verify that a sync job has been planned.

<Note>If you need help setting up either side of the sync (e.g., you want to sync Airtable with Postgres but don't have Postgres set up yet), just ping us at eng@usebracket.com! We're happy to help with that setup.</Note>
