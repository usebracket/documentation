Startups use Bracket to keep their spend low. By setting up cheap, custom data flows, our startup users avoid expensive analytics software or wasting precious engineering hours on in-house solutions. 

Here are some ways startups use Bracket today to move quickly and minimize burn. 

## Toggle feature flags for your users from a spreadsheet

**Problem:** Startups are constantly experimenting with pricing plans and the features they unlock. Beyond that, startups often want to customize their product UX for high-value & enterprise users. Usually, the Sales and CX teams know most about which features a user should be able to access, but it falls to engineering to actually implement the feature flags.

**How Bracket helps:** Get your sales and CX team to have full control over which features each user sees. If your eng team can simplify feature toggles to boolean fields, then you can use Bracket to sync those toggles between your backend and, e.g., a Google Sheet. 

This allows your CX team full control over a user's experience, and saves engineering time for bigger projects. This setup also doubles as a tool for upselling: give your sales team access to the G Sheet, and they can quickly prioritize upselling based on which features a user can't yet access. 

## Make it easy to share data with users and third parties

**Problem:** When startups need to transfer data between themselves and other parties, the question arises: do we build this functionality into our app, or do we just share a CSV? It takes far less time to do the latter, but this requires your eng team to stand up and maintain data pipelines -- _or_, you get stuck with a ton of manual copy & paste.

**How Bracket helps:** Instead of custom data ingestions or time-consuming copy & paste, you can use Bracket to set up quick syncs between a third-party-facing data table and your DB. Here are some examples:

1. As a SaaS startup, create an MVP onboarding form using [Airtable forms](https://support.airtable.com/docs/how-to-create-a-form-in-airtable), collect the data in Airtable, and sync it over to your DB using Bracket.
2. As a logistics startup, collaborate on orders & fulfillment data with your third-party vendors by syncing orders data into a Google Sheet shared with the vendor. The vendor updates order statuses directly in the Sheet.
3. As an edtech startup, assign new students to your contracted mentors by syncing students to a shared Airtable, where the mentors can then document their students' progress and performance. Sync that performance data back to your backend, where you can show it to your students through your app.

## Create a god-view dashboard of your users

**Problem:** As a founder, it's easy to miss data about your users. Merging usage analytics, payment details, and demographic data can become a nightmare when your team is small and you're moving fast. As a result, you can struggle to get a holistic view of your progress towards PMF.

**How Bracket helps:** Get all of your data into a simple, low-maintenance spreadsheet. Whether you prefer Airtable, G Sheets, or Notion, you can use Bracket to sync your user and product data into a single tab. 

Check it every morning, see who's signing up, understand who is using your product and how, and move faster towards PMF, all without spending big money on BI tools.

## Monitor onboarding to get users over the finish line

**Problem:** Startups with multi-step onboarding processes can lose users during onboarding. Unless addressed, this leaky funnel hurts your bottom line.

**How Bracket helps:** Keep real-time tabs on the progress of their users through the onboarding process. Sync signups from your backend to Airtable using Bracket. In Airtable, set up notifications for new row entries, so you're alerted whenever a new user has been added. 

Within Airtable, you can quickly filter to users with incomplete onboarding details and assign teammates to follow up with the user. YOu can also manually input missing details, and with Bracket's two-way sync, the details are synced back to your backend for a complete source of truth. 

We see startups double their onboarding completion rate by using Bracket.
