## Create Bracket integration

  1. Navigate to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations

  2. Create a new internal integration by clicking the “New integration” button

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/notion-integration-step-1.png" />
</Example>

3. Fill in associated information. The workspace should include the table(s) you would like to sync. Make sure to check the permissions shown below

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/notion-integration-step-2.png" />
</Example>

4. Copy the internal integration token (shown below) and enter it into the Bracket web app.

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/notion-integration-step-3.png" />
</Example>

## Add Bracket integration to the table you want to sync

1. Go to the specific Notion table you would like to sync, and click on the three dots in the upper right of the window. Click "Add connections."

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/notion-integration-add-integration-to-table.png" />
</Example>

2. Select the Bracket integration you just created in the steps above. Click "Confirm."
3. Double check that the integration has been correctly added by again clicking on the three dots at the upper right of the page and confirming that the integration shows up (example below)

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/notion-integration-confirm-integration-to-table.png" />
