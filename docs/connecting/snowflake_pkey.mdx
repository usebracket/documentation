## Summary

To enable syncing with Bracket, make sure your Snowflake table has a primary key constraint. 

## How to set up your primary key

Each Snowflake table you sync with Bracket should have a primary key constraint. To do this, you can add this constraint when creating the table in Snowflake:

```DDL
CREATE TABLE table
    (pkey INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    CONSTRAINT table_pk PRIMARY KEY (pkey))
```
This ensures that all newly added records, whether inserted directly to Snowflake or synced from a paired data source, will adopt primary keys with uniform formatting and unique values. 

In the field mapping, you are able to sync the primary key to a field in the opposing data source for reference, but any edits made to the primary key in the opposing source will not sync back to Snowflake.
