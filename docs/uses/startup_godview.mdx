**Problem:** As a founder, it's easy to miss data about your users. Merging usage analytics, payment details, and demographic data can become a nightmare when your team is small and you're moving fast. As a result, you can struggle to get a holistic view of your progress towards PMF.

**How Bracket helps:** Get all of your data into a simple, low-maintenance spreadsheet. Whether you prefer Airtable, G Sheets, or Notion, you can use Bracket to sync your user and product data into a single tab. 

Check it every morning, see who's signing up, understand who is using your product and how, and move faster towards PMF, all without spending big money on BI tools.
