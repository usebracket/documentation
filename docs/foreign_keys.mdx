## Summary

The ability to link records across tables is one of the key features of both Postgres and Airtable. In this guide, we walk through how to maintain record relations between the two with a Bracket sync. 

<Note>Note that Bracket currently only supports 1:1 and 1:many relations in a Postgres <> Airtable sync, so for the purposes of this guide, we will leave out many-to-many relations</Note>
