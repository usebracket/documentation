## Basics

Our MongoDB integration is currently live. Users can connect whole collections with tools like Airtable and Notion. Changes in MongoDB are reflected in real time!

## Allowed fields

The following fields are currently accepted for Bracket's bidirectional syncing

- Double
- String
- Boolean
- Date
- 32-bit integer
- 64-bit integer
- Decimal128
- JSON objects
- Lists & Arrays

## Deletes

When deleting a key in a MongoDB document (let's say you want to delete a `field1` field), users should set it as the value to `null` as opposed to deleting the key. This will make sure that Airtable receives that key deletion, because Bracket performs a `PATCH` rather than a destructive `PUT`.
