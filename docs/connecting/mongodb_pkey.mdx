## Summary

Bracket uses MongoDB ObjectId values to uniquely map each document to the opposing data source. The user does not need to do any prep work to configure primary keys. 

<Tip>If you would like to sync the MongoDB ObjectId to a field in the opposing data sources, just add the `_id` field to the field mapping. The `_id` field will be read-only in the opposing source.</Tip>
