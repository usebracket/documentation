title: 'Product Waitlist'
---

If youâ€™re a startup only letting a limited number of companies use your product, or a larger company releasing beta features to a specific set of a customers, well then you have a waitlist on your hands. 

With Bracket, you can easily remove customers off of the waitlist and provide access to your product by adjusting a cell in a Google Sheet that talks to Snowflake.
