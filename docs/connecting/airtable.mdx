## Getting an API key

1. Navigate to your account page by clicking on your user icon on the top right of the homepage then clicking `Account`.

2. Under the API section, if you have not yet generated an API key, you will see a button that says `Generate API Key`. Click that button. If you already have an API key, do not change it because it can break any existing API integrations you have set up.

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/airtable-1.png" />
</Example>

3. Copy the key that's created and send it to Bracket via Slack. If you already have a key, copy the existing key.

<TipInfo>
  NOTE: If you change your API key at any time, this will break syncing through
  Bracket.
</TipInfo>

## Sharing read-only version of Airtable base

1. Open the Airtable base holding the table(s) you would like synced through Bracket.
2. Click "Share" in the top right of the base.
3. Under "Email invite", enter eng@usebracket.com and select "Read only" from the drop-down, as seen below.

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/airtable-2-share-link.png" />
</Example>

4. Click "Invite".
