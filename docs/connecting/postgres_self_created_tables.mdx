<Note>While we recommend that you allow Bracket to build a table for you, here is a guide
  for using a table that you've created yourself</Note>

## General requirements

1. A unique identifier (we recommend snake case field names), and our default table generation
creates a field called `bracket_pkey`.

2. To be able to insert into postgres, you must have a default value. We recommend using the
builtin function `gen_random_uuid()`.

3. In order to leverage the a more efficient polling mechanism where only recently
updated/inserted records are polled, you must include a field that tracks when records were
modified. When Bracket builds a base for you, we create a field called `bracket_last_modified`
and add a trigger/function that updates that field's value whenever the record is updated.


Here's some default SQL that can help you get started:

<CodeGroup>

  ```sql create_table.sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_name.table_name (
      bracket_pkey UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() primary key,
      bracket_last_modified TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
      created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
      field_1 TEXT
  );
  ```


  ```sql updated_timestamp_function.sql
  create function bracket_update_timestamp() returns trigger
      language plpgsql
  as
  $$
        BEGIN
          NEW.bracket_last_modified = NOW();
          RETURN NEW;
        END;
        $$;
  alter function bracket_update_timestamp() owner to postgres;

  ```



  ```sql updated_timestamp_trigger.sql
  CREATE TRIGGER "update_bracket_last_modified_for_table_name"
  BEFORE UPDATE ON schema_name.table_name
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION bracket_update_timestamp();
  ```
