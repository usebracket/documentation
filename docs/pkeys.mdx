description: 'How Bracket uniquely identifies records'
---

To support safe syncing, Bracket matches records based on their primary key. Below, we layout what Bracket uses for primary keys depending on the data source, and if there is any prep work needed from you. 

| Tool                                  | Primary key                            | Preparation needed? 
| --------------------------------      | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------
| [Airtable](/connecting/airtable)      | Airtable record ID                     | No
| [Notion](/connecting/notion)          | Notion object ID                       | No
| [Google Sheets](/connecting/gsheets)  | Unique field created by user           | Yes, see guide
| [Postgres](/connecting/postgres)      | Unique field created by user           | Yes, see guide
| [MongoDB](/database/mongodb)          | MongoDB object ID                      | No
| [Snowflake](/database/snowflake)      | Unique field created by user           | Yes, see guide


## 4. Choose your sync direction

Choose a one-way or two-way sync. If you'd like to customize the sync so that certain fields are one-way and others are two-way, just ping us. 

## 5. Review the fields to be synced and choose sync frequency

After clicking "Review," you'll be taken to the admin page for the newly created connection

Before you initiate the sync, you should:
1. Make sure the field names and intersection types are accurate
    - `UNIQUE KEY` is just an identifier for that field pairing. It doesn't matter what format this is in.
    - Verify that the field names for each data source have appropriate capitalization, spaces, etc.
    - `INTERSECTION TYPE` is the most granular field type available between the two data source fields. For example, if you are syncing a `select` field in Airtable with a `string` field in Postgres, then choose `select` here.
2. Update the sync frequency as needed. The default frequency is five minutes, and the fastest frequency is one minute.

## 6. Initiate sync

Toggle `Active` to begin the sync. Refresh the page and scroll to the bottom to verify that a sync job has been planned.

<Note>If you need help setting up either side of the sync (e.g., you want to sync Airtable with Postgres but don't have Postgres set up yet), just ping us at eng@usebracket.com! We're happy to help with that setup.</Note>
