Bidirectional data syncing has many applications for Growth teams that need to move quickly.

## Piloting quickly

You want to quickly pilot your lending startup in a new country, but you don't want to stand up a new version of your consumer-facing lending app. Instead, you send a few loan officers to transact in-person, but they need a way to quickly approve and reject clients in a way that enriches your data warehouse.

With Bracket, you link Google Sheets and MySQL so that your front-facing team can enter loan applications into Sheets, your backend team approves/rejects the loan in MySQL, and the decision gets pushed back into Sheets in real-time.
