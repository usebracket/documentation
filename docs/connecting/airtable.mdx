## Getting an API key

- Navigate to your account page by clicking on your user icon on the top right of the homepage then clicking `Account`.

- Under the API section, if you have not yet generated an API key, you will see a button that says `Generate API Key`. Click that button. If you already have an API key, do not change it because it can break any existing API integrations you have set up.

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/airtable-1.png" />
</Example>

- Copy the key that's created and send it to Bracket via Slack. If you already have a key, copy the existing key.

<TipInfo>
  NOTE: If you change your API key at any time, this will break syncing through
  Bracket.
</TipInfo>

## Sending copy of Airtable base

- Open the Airtable base holding the tab(s) you would like synced through Bracket
- Click the down arrow to the right of the base name at the top of the page:

<Example>
  <img class="rounded-md w-full" src="/img/airtable-2.png" />
</Example>

- Click the three dots in the modal window that appears, then click `Duplicate Base`
- In the duplicated base, delete any tabs you do not want to sync through Bracket. You can also delete all of the records, leaving just the field names.
- Share the cleaned base copy with eng@usebracket.com with read-only permissions. This will prevent you from getting charged for additional users on your Airtable plan.
