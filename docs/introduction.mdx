## The basics

Bracket enables you to set up fast, flexible one-way or two-way syncs between CRMs like Salesforce and databases like Postgres.

Bracket is designed for engineers, but is simple enough to use without a technical background.

## Some notes on our philosophy

1. **We build what you want.** Is Bracket 80% of the way to fulfilling your use case but missing one crucial feature or integration? Tell us and we'll build it.
2. **We respond quickly and fix problems ASAP**. Just ask our users.
3. **We're here to build something we're proud of.** Some companies see users as a path to an exit; we see users as our sounding board for whether we're building something valuable. We're not just saying it: your honest feedback is invaluable to us.
4. **Talent is global.** We met while working for startups in Turkey and Indonesia. We're remote-first and our first hire was outside the US.
5. **Simplicity should not compromise power.** We want Bracket to be so simple and intuitive a non-engineer could use it, while being powerful and flexible enough to accomodate the hackiest engineer.
