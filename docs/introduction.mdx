## The basics

Bracket enables you to set up limitlessly flexible one-way or two-way syncs between any pairing of database or SaaS tool.

Bracket is designed for engineers, but is simple enough to use without a technical background.

## Integrations & support

Currently, Bracket supports the following integrations:

1. [Google Sheets](/spreadsheet/gsheets)
2. [Airtable](/spreadsheet/airtable)
3. [Notion](/spreadsheet/notion)
4. [Postgres](/database/postgres)
5. [MongoDB](/database/mongodb)
6. [DynamoDB](/database/dynamodb)
7. [Firebase](/database/firebase)
8. [Snowflake](/database/snowflake)

We support our users through whatever channel is most convenient for you: Slack, Discord, email, even text! You can request a private Slack or Discord group by emailing us @ founders@usebracket.com.

## Some notes on our philosophy

1. **We build what you want.** Is Bracket 80% of the way to fulfilling your use case but missing one crucial feature or integration? Tell us and we'll build it.
2. **We respond quickly and fix problems ASAP**. Just ask our users. 
3. **We're here to build something we're proud of.** Some companies see users as a path to an exit; we see users as our sounding board for whether we're building something valuable. We're not just saying it: your honest feedback is invaluable to us.
4. **Talent is global.** We met while working for startups in Turkey and Indonesia. We're remote-first and our first hire was outside the US. 
5. **Simplicity should not compromise power.** We want Bracket to be so simple and intuitive a non-engineer could use it, while being powerful and flexible enough to accomodate the hackiest engineer.
