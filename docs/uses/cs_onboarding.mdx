## Monitor onboarding to get users over the finish line

**Problem:** Startups with multi-step onboarding processes can lose users during onboarding. Unless addressed, this leaky funnel hurts your bottom line.

**How Bracket helps:** Keep real-time tabs on the progress of their users through the onboarding process. Sync signups from your backend to Airtable using Bracket. In Airtable, set up notifications for new row entries, so you're alerted whenever a new user has been added. 

Within Airtable, you can quickly filter to users with incomplete onboarding details and assign teammates to follow up with the user. You can also manually input missing details, and with Bracket's two-way sync, the details are synced back to your backend for a complete source of truth. 

We see startups double their onboarding completion rate by using Bracket.
