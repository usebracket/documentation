Bidirectional data syncing has many applications for Sales & Partnership teams that need to move quickly.

## Vetting leads data

When pulling third-party data into your backend (e.g., supplier leads data from a scraper), your partnerships team needs to contextualize & qualify the leads. Where are they based? What is the quality of the lead? What is their pricing structure?

With Bracket, your partnerships team can see the scraper's results in real-time pushed to a tool like Airtable and vet those leads in the same environment. The data then gets synced with the backend for complete, usable leads data.
