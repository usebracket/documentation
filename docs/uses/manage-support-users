Teams use Bracket to manage their users and support their users quickly.. Here are some real-world examples of how teams use Bracket to move faster on .

## Monitor the user onboarding process

A company with a multi-step onboarding process uses Bracket to keep real-time tabs on the progress of their users through the onboarding process. Users sign up on the company's web-app, the details are sent to MongoDB, and then synced with Airtable using Bracket. The founders and support team set up notifications for new row entries in Airtable, so they're alerted whenever a new user has been added. 

Within Airtable, the team can quickly filter to users with incomplete onboarding details and assign members of their team to follow up with the user. The team can also manually input missing details, and with Bracket's two-way sync, the details are synced back to MongoDB for a complete source of truth. 

With Bracket in place, their onboarding completion rate increased from 40% to 83%.
