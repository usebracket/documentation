## The basics

Bracket connects your favorite SaaS tools (like G Sheets, [Airtable](/spreadsheet/airtable), and [Notion](/spreadsheet/notion)) with your [backend database](/database/mongodb).

With Bracket, you can stop diverting engineering resources towards building internal data tools. Instead, simply link the tools your team already uses, and voila: real-time data, no-code required.

## Integrations & support

Currently, Bracket supports syncing with Airtable, Notion, and any backend database.

## Why you should keep using spreadsheets

In a world of a billion Saas tools, spreadsheets - infinitely malleable, deeply familiar - are still the go-to tool for most business users. Whether for ad hoc analyses or a company's entire CRM, spreadsheets have not only survived but evolved. We're no longer stuck with local Microsoft Excel files. We now have beautiful, feature-rich browser-based tools like Airtable and Notion.

Your business users are faster and happier using spreadsheets, and they reveal their preferences every time they click "export to CSV" in a dashboard or internal app.

**We believe it's better to maximize spreadsheets than to replace them. For that to happen, they need better connectors.**

We built Bracket because we spent months at former jobs trying to get data in siloed spreadsheets to match production data in large databases.
