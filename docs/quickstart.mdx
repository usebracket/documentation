Bracket lets you connect popular tools and backend databases for two-way or one-way syncs. In this guide, we'll talk through how to get everything connected in a few quick steps.

<Info>If you'd like to join a private Slack or Discord group with our team for support or questions, just ping us at founders@usebracket.com</Info>

## 1. Create an account on our web app

## 2. Enter connection details for each connection

On the web app, you'll need to enter certain connection details to get syncs running. See below for a summary of what information you'll need.

| Tool                                  | What you'll need                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------      | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Airtable](/connecting/airtable)      | API key and link to Airtable base                                                                                                 |
| [Notion](/connecting/notion)          | Create integration token and add it to the table you want to sync                                                                 |
| [Google Sheets](/connection/gsheets)  | Share Sheet with Bracket service account and get the Sheet ID                                                                     |
| [Postgres](/connecting/postgres)      | Connection string URI                                                                                                             |
| [MongoDB](/database/mongodb)          | Connection string URI with Bracket as added user and whitelisting IP address 0.0.0.0/0                                            |

## 3. Make sure your tools are ready for syncs

There are two prerequisites for a successful sync:
    1. Make sure your field names match each other identically across the two tools
    2. Make sure at least one tool is empty of data

## 4. Click "Save" and start syncing

<Note>If you need help setting up either side of the sync (e.g., you want to sync Airtable with Postgres but don't have Postgres set up yet), just ping us at eng@usebracket.com! We're happy to help with that setup.</Note>
